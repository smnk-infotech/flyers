# AI Agent Instructions for the Flyers Charitable Trust Website

This document provides guidance for AI agents working on the Flyers Charitable Trust website codebase.

## 1. Project Overview & Architecture

This is a **static website** that was originally built using **WordPress with the Elementor page builder** and the Astra theme. The code in this repository is the static export (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) of that WordPress site.

- **It is not a typical hand-coded project.** The HTML structure and CSS class names are generated by Elementor. Do not attempt to refactor or rename Elementor's class names (e.g., `elementor-widget-heading`, `elementor-section-wrap`).
- The site is purely presentational. There is no backend logic, database, or complex data flow.
- The main pages are individual HTML files like `index.html`, `About Us – Flyers Charitable Trust.html`, etc.
- All styles are in the `css/` directory, and scripts are in `js/`.
- For a high-level overview of the design system (colors, fonts), refer to `README/README.md`.

## 2. Developer Workflows

### Local Development

There is no build process. To preview the site locally, you need to serve the files with a simple static web server.

**Recommended command (using Python):**
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
Alternatively, use a VS Code extension like "Live Server".

### Deployment

The website is configured for deployment to **Firebase Hosting**.

- The deployment process is managed by the `deploy.ps1` PowerShell script.
- To deploy, run the script and provide your Firebase Project ID when prompted:
  ```powershell
  .\deploy.ps1 -ProjectId your-firebase-project-id
  ```
- The script handles logging into Firebase and deploying the contents of the root directory, as configured in `firebase.json`.

### CSS Hotfix

A recurring issue from the WordPress export is an incorrect CSS variable syntax.
- The `scripts/fix-css.ps1` script was created to fix this.
- It replaces `background-color:(--ast-global-dark-bg-style)` with the correct `background-color:var(--ast-global-dark-bg-style)` in all HTML files.
- If you encounter rendering issues related to background colors, run this script.

## 3. Key Files & Conventions

- **`firebase.json`**: Defines the Firebase hosting configuration, including security headers and rewrite rules. All pages are served from `index.html` for client-side routing if needed, but in this static setup, it ensures clean URLs work.
- **`deploy.ps1`**: The primary script for deploying the site to Firebase.
- **`README/README.md`**: Contains essential information about the original WordPress setup, color scheme, fonts, and integrations like Google Maps and reCAPTCHA.
- **`css/post-*.css`**: These files contain styles specific to pages generated by Elementor.
- **`css/frontend.min.css`**: Contains the main styles from Elementor's frontend framework.
