# AI Agent Instructions for the Flyers Charitable Trust Website

This document provides guidance for AI agents working on the Flyers Charitable Trust website codebase.

## 1. Project Overview & Architecture

This is a **static website** that was originally built using **WordPress with the Elementor page builder** and the Astra theme. The code in this repository is the static export (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) of that WordPress site.

- **It is not a typical hand-coded project.** The HTML structure and CSS class names are generated by Elementor. Do not attempt to refactor or rename Elementor's class names (e.g., `elementor-widget-heading`, `elementor-section-wrap`).
- The site is purely presentational. There is no backend logic, database, or complex data flow.
- **File naming:** Main pages use special characters in filenames (e.g., `About Us – Flyers Charitable Trust.html`). Some newer files use standard naming (e.g., `About-Us.html`). The home page is `Flyers Charitable Trust – Flyers Charitable Trust In Coimbatore.html`.
- Each HTML page has a corresponding `*_files/` directory containing CSS, JS, and other assets specific to that page (e.g., `About Us – Flyers Charitable Trust_files/`).
- For a high-level overview of the design system (colors, fonts), refer to `README/README.md`.

## 2. Developer Workflows

### Local Development

There is no build process. To preview the site locally, you need to serve the files with a simple static web server.

**Recommended command (using Python):**
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
Alternatively, use a VS Code extension like "Live Server" or PowerShell:
```powershell
python -m http.server 8000
```

### Deployment

The website can be deployed to **Firebase Hosting** (configured in `firebase.json`) or GitHub Pages (via `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`).

**Firebase Deployment (if scripts are available):**
- If a `deploy.ps1` PowerShell script exists, run it with your Firebase Project ID
- Alternatively, use Firebase CLI directly: `firebase deploy --only hosting`

**GitHub Pages Deployment:**
- The repository has a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`) that validates the site on push to main
- Firebase configuration includes security headers (X-Frame-Options, CSP, HSTS) for production deployment

### CSS Hotfix

A recurring issue from the WordPress export is an incorrect CSS variable syntax that causes rendering problems.

**The Bug:** Inline CSS in HTML files contains `background-color:(--ast-global-dark-bg-style)` instead of the correct `background-color:var(--ast-global-dark-bg-style)`.

**To Fix:**
- If a `scripts/fix-css.ps1` script exists, run it to batch-fix all HTML files
- Otherwise, manually search and replace in all HTML files:
  - Find: `background-color:(--ast-global-dark-bg-style)`
  - Replace with: `background-color:var(--ast-global-dark-bg-style)`
- This bug affects multiple pages (confirmed in: About-Us.html, Services, Gallery, Home, Donation, Contact pages)

## 3. Key Files & Conventions

- **`firebase.json`**: Defines the Firebase hosting configuration, including security headers (X-Frame-Options, CSP, HSTS) and rewrite rules. The rewrite rules send all requests to `/index.html` but this is mainly for future routing—currently the site uses direct HTML file access.
- **`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`**: GitHub Actions workflow that validates the site on push to main branch.
- **`README/README.md`**: Contains essential information about the original WordPress setup, color scheme, fonts (Inter, Plus Jakarta Sans), and integrations like Google Maps and reCAPTCHA.
- **Page-specific assets**: Each HTML page has a corresponding `*_files/` directory (e.g., `About Us – Flyers Charitable Trust_files/`) containing that page's CSS, JS, and other assets.
- **Design System**:
  - Primary Blue: #060097 (--ast-global-color-0)
  - Accent Purple: #c10fff (--ast-global-color-1)
  - Heading Text: #1e293b (--ast-global-color-2)
  - Body Text: #67768e (--ast-global-color-3)
  - Accent Yellow: #ffcd57 (--ast-global-color-7)
