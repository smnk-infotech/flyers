NOTES
===============================================================================

- About Us sub-pages (except Our-Story-Team.html) still show generic 
  "About Us" content. These can be customized in future updates.
- Font files (fa-solid-900, fa-brands-400, eicons) show 404 errors but
  don't affect functionality (icons still display via CSS fallbacks)
- Privacy Policy and Terms & Conditions are standalone pages without
  navigation headers (by design)
